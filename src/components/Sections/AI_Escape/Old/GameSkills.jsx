                    <li><strong>Akinator (Deductive and Multi-hop Reasoning) :</strong> 
                    <br />
                    Players challenge the AI by having it guess objects based on a series of yes/no questions. The AI demonstrates deductive reasoning by deriving specific conclusions from general premises, while multi-hop reasoning is showcased as it connects sequential information to narrow down the possibilities to the correct answer. This controlled setting evaluates the AI's ability to formulate and refine hypotheses over multiple rounds.</li>

                    <li><strong>Taboo (Abductive and Multi-hop Reasoning):</strong>
                    <br />
                    The player tries to induce the AI into saying the target word without directly mentioning it. If the AI says the target word, the player wins. The AI employs abductive reasoning to generate hypotheses from fragmented clues, trying to guess the secret word while avoiding saying it directly. The game tests the AI's ability to infer under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity, utilizing multi-hop reasoning to connect information provided by the player. This game evaluates the AI's capacity to handle incomplete information and arrive at the most probable conclusion.</li>

                    <li><strong>Bluffing (Inductive and Multi-hop Reasoning):</strong> 
                    <br />
                    The Bluffing game challenges the AI's inductive reasoning by having it determine the truthfulness of statements made by players based on observed responses. The AI uses multi-hop reasoning to connect these observations and formulate a logical conclusion about the player's honesty. This game assesses the AI's ability to detect deception and its strategic questioning prowess, which are crucial for understanding and responding to human interactions in realistic scenarios.</li>
